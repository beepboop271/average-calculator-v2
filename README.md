# average-calculator-v2
typescript and google cloud :thinking:

todo:
* use firestore to save data
* use cloud functions to poll ta.yrdsb.ca (questionable use case, i know), update firestore, and send notifications via fcm
* react native? ? mobile app? ? ?  ?
* electron? ? ?  desktop app ? ? ? ?
* learn all the things :)

# this isn't really a v2 in the sense that it is improving substantially on average-calculator, it's v2 in the sense that it's a totally different program (though with the same *general* goal), which is why i created a new repo instead of just adding onto average-calculator.
