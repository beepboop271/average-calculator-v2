# average-calculator-v2
typescript and google cloud :thinking:

use firestore to save data and cloud functions to poll ta.yrdsb.ca, update firestore, and send notifications via fcm

this isn't really a v2 in the sense that it is improving substantially on average-calculator, it's v2 in the sense that it's a totally different program (though with the same *general* goal), which is why i created a new repo instead of just adding onto average-calculator.
